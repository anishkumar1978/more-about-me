    <h2>Hello everyone! My name is Aishwarya and I am in 7th grade. Let me tell you about my hobbies:-
      I love to cycle and skate as they both give me a sense of freedom which is priceless! I also love to read mystery and fiction books and diaries. Sherlock Holmes, Nancy Drew, Adventure Series are some of favourites. I also have a soft spot for cooking goodies. Coding is also my favourite hobby to do while I am bored. When you give the correct code, an amazing output comes. How cool is that?! Attempting scientific expiriments are also my favourite. Pouring 1 substance to another to form another component. I also love to dance and sing. Ed Sheeren, Alan Walker, Marshmello, AR Rahaman are a few of my favourite singers.Listening to music is what I love the most.  </h2>
